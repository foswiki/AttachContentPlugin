---+!! Attach Content Plugin
%$SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Overview

This plugin puts any text between a =%<nop>STARTATTACH{"filename"}%= and =%<nop>ENDATTACH%= into an attachment with the given filename.

Pass filename, topic, web or comment as parameters.

The current version only refreshes the attachment when the topic is saved. Obviously this means that the attachment can get out of synch if, for example, it explicitly or implicitly refers to other topics.

This plugin is written specifically to be able to put css into topic(s) and still be able to have efficient stylesheets: i.e., without the overhead of Foswiki processing. The feature can be used for many other things where you want Foswiki to generate a plain text file a smart way. %BR%
For example: write a =SEARCH= in a topic and save the search results to an XML file. The XML data can be used for efficient look-up.

---++ Syntax Rules

Write:

<pre>
%<nop>STARTATTACH{"filename"}%
content-to-be-saved
%<nop>ENDATTACH%
</pre>

You can pass a number of parameters:

---+++ Parameters
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* | *Example* |
| =topic=       | Topic to save the attachment to.  | - (the current topic is used) | =topic="WebHome"= |
| =web=         | Web where the save topic is located.  | - (the current Web is used) | =web="Main"= |
| =comment=     | Attachment comment text.  | the default ={AttachmentComment}= text in [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%/#AttachContentPlugin$Extensions][configure]]  | =comment="User data as of %<nop>DATE%"= |
| =hide=        | Use =hide="on"= to hide the attachment in normal topic view.  | =off= | =hide="on"= |
| =keeppars=    | Keep paragraph =&lt;p /&gt;= tags, =&lt;nop&gt;= tags, and square bracket type links | the default ={KeepPars}= text in [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%/#AttachContentPlugin$Extensions][configure]] | =keeppars="on"= |
| =hidecontent= | Hide content from view. | - (the "content-to-be-saved" is visible) | =hidecontent="on"= |

---++ Examples

---+++ Creating a color scheme

See: PatternSkinColorSettings. This topic uses !AttachContentPlugin to write a CSS file for colors. Color values are set dynamically in the topic. On topic save the CSS file is attached to the topic and can be referred to using variable =USERCOLORSURL=.

#UserDataXml
---+++ User data XML

<a href="%SCRIPTURL{save}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?action_save=1">Update user data XML</a>

<verbatim>
%STARTATTACH{"userdata.xml" comment="User data as of %DATE%"}%
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<users>
%SEARCH{ "[F]irstName.*value=.*()" web="%MAINWEB%" type="regex" nonoise="on" excludetopic="UserForm,ProjectContributor,WikiGuest,UnknownUser" format="<user><firstname><![CDATA[$formfield(FirstName)]]></firstname><lastname><![CDATA[$formfield(LastName)]]></lastname><url><![CDATA[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/$topic]]></url></user>" }%
</users>
%ENDATTACH%
</verbatim>
